"""Handler for RuntimeTick - memory lifecycle TTL evaluation.

This handler processes RuntimeTick events from the runtime scheduler
and evaluates memory entities for TTL expiration and archive eligibility.
It queries the memory lifecycle projection for entities that need lifecycle
transition events emitted.

Detection Logic:
    For Memory Expiration:
        - Query projection for ACTIVE memories with expires_at <= now
        - Use projection.needs_expiration_event() for deduplication
        - Emit ModelMemoryExpiredEvent for each expired memory

    For Archive Initiation:
        - Query projection for EXPIRED memories with archived_at IS NULL
        - Use projection.needs_archive_event() for deduplication
        - Emit ModelMemoryArchiveInitiated for each archive candidate

Deduplication:
    The projection stores emission markers (expiration_emitted_at,
    archive_initiated_at) to prevent duplicate lifecycle events.
    The projection reader filters out already-emitted transitions.

Coroutine Safety:
    This handler is stateless and coroutine-safe for concurrent calls
    with different tick instances.

Container-Driven Pattern:
    This handler follows the ONEX container-driven initialization pattern:
    - Constructor takes only ModelONEXContainer
    - Dependencies are injected via initialize()
    - health_check() and describe() provide introspection

class HandlerMemoryTick:
    """Handler for RuntimeTick - memory lifecycle TTL evaluation.

    This handler processes runtime tick events and scans the memory
    lifecycle projection for entities with expired TTLs or pending
    archival. It emits lifecycle transition events for entities that
    need them, using projection emission markers for deduplication.

    Container-Driven Pattern:
        This handler follows the ONEX container-driven initialization pattern:
        - Constructor takes only ModelONEXContainer for DI compliance
        - Dependencies are injected via async initialize() method
        - health_check() provides health status for monitoring
        - describe() provides handler metadata for introspection

    Lifecycle Evaluation:
        The handler performs two scans on each tick:
        1. Expiration: Find ACTIVE memories with expires_at <= now
        2. Archive initiation: Find EXPIRED memories pending archive

    Projection Queries:
        Uses dedicated projection reader methods that filter by:
        - Deadline < now (TTL has passed)
        - Emission marker IS NULL (not yet emitted)
        - Appropriate lifecycle state (ACTIVE for expiration, EXPIRED for archive)

    Time Injection:
        Uses the `now` timestamp from RuntimeTick for deterministic
        evaluation, enabling reproducible tests and consistent behavior
        across distributed deployments.

    Attributes:
        _container: ONEX container for dependency injection.
        _projection_reader: Reader for memory lifecycle projection state.
        _batch_size: Maximum memories to process per tick (default: 100).
