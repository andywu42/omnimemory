"""State machine validator for memory lifecycle transitions.

This module validates that lifecycle state transitions follow the defined
5-state memory lifecycle state machine.

State Machine:
    ACTIVE -> STALE -> EXPIRED -> ARCHIVED -> DELETED

    ARCHIVED -> ACTIVE is also valid, representing a memory restoration
    operation (archived memory returned to the active set).

Valid Transitions:
    ACTIVE  -> STALE    (soft TTL exceeded, still accessible)
    ACTIVE  -> EXPIRED  (hard TTL exceeded, direct expiration)
    ACTIVE  -> DELETED  (explicit delete of active memory)
    STALE   -> EXPIRED  (hard TTL exceeded after staleness)
    STALE   -> ACTIVE   (refreshed, promoted back to active)
    STALE   -> DELETED  (explicit delete of stale memory)
    EXPIRED -> ARCHIVED (moved to cold storage)
    EXPIRED -> DELETED  (explicit delete of expired memory)
    ARCHIVED -> ACTIVE  (promoted/restored from archive)
    ARCHIVED -> DELETED (explicit delete of archived memory)
    DELETED -> (none)   (terminal state - no transitions allowed)

Invalid Transitions:
    DELETED -> any      (terminal state, no recovery)
    ARCHIVED -> EXPIRED (must restore to ACTIVE first)
    ARCHIVED -> STALE   (must restore to ACTIVE first)
    EXPIRED -> ACTIVE   (must go through ARCHIVED)
    EXPIRED -> STALE    (invalid regression)
