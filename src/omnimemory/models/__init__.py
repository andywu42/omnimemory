"""
ONEX Model Package - OmniMemory Foundation Architecture

Models are organized into functional domains following omnibase_core patterns:
- core/: Foundational models, shared types, contracts
- memory/: Memory storage, retrieval, persistence models
- intelligence/: Intelligence processing, analysis models
- service/: Service configurations, orchestration models
- container/: Container configurations and DI models
- foundation/: Base implementations and protocols

This __init__.py maintains compatibility by re-exporting
all models at the package level following ONEX standards.
